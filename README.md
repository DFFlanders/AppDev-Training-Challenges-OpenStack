# AppDev-Training-Challenges-OpenStack
Question bank of 'problem based learning challenges' to train Application Developers in building OpenStack Cloud Apps.

Phase 1: This repository breaks down Openstack's "My First App Guide" and turns it into various "problem-sets".  These sets of problems (aka learning challenges) are intended for use alongside face-to-face demonstrations, presentations and training.  

## How to use this bank of learning challenges

As a trainer who is helping application developers learn how to use OpenStack you don't want to bore your participants via 'death by powerpoint'.  Yes slides are essentiall, but the average human brain turns off after ~7 minutes of being talked at; accordingly, we recommend you do a bit of 'chalking & talking' (presenting and live coding), then have your participants work together to solve some fun learning challenges.  Here in this repository you'll find a bank of these challenges, so you can pick and choose from which to use when you design your applicationi developer training.

## How to contribute problems to this learning challenges bank

A good set of challenges are a kind of beautiful puzzle which will be a great value to your participants as they learn how to make cloud applications.  Like any code repository, your contributions are done through branching and submitting pull requests.

To contribute a new 'learning challenge' please submit a minimum of 3x learning challenges (as a single file) including:

1. Novice problem, e.g. a problem which 2-7 people can all easily solve as a group, which perhaps generates discussion.
2. Intermediate problem, e.g. a problem which will take a bit of time to solve, and which should stump the novices in the room.
3. Advanced problem, e.g. a problem which only a small percentrage of your trainees will be able to solve.  Keep an eye out for who solves they problems, recruit them to be helpers at future training.

While the minimum problem-set MUST have 3x challenges, additional challenges and or contextual information may be provided in the same file, such as:

 * Additional problems, i.e. Uber advanced extra bonus points problem: create auto monitorring and orchestration basedon regional location of cores/nodes.
 * Pictures of slides to remind the participants of what you orignally demonstrated, etc.
 * Links and references to what other problem-sets which are applicable.
 * Inline dode snippet instruction, FAQ and metaphors/analogy for how to remember the problem.
 * etc

Most importantly, remember that a well designed learning challenge is like a fun puzzle or riddle which if well worded and presented will be a joy for all to partipate in learning.

# Ok, now it's your turn...
1. Start by branching the following template problem-set file: https://github.com/DFFlanders/AppDev-Training-Challenges-OpenStack/blob/master/template-problem-set
2. Once you've created your own learning challenge, with a minimum of 3x problems then submit a pull request so we can add your problem-set to master bank of learning challenges for OpenStack application developer training!
3. We'll start tweeting and singing your praises on the mailing list so our community of trainers can start using your newly minted learning challenges in their training.
