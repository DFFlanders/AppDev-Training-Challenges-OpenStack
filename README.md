# AppDev-Training-Challenges-OpenStack
Question bank of 'problem based learning challenges' for use in training Application Developers in building OpenStack APPs.

This repository breaks down Openstack's My First App Guide and turns it into a problem-sets.  These sets of problems (or learning challenges) are intended for use in face-to-face training of application developers.  

## How to use this bank of learning challenges

As a trainer who is helping application developers learn how to use OpenStack you don't want to bore your participants via 'death by powerpoint'.  Yes slides are essentiall, but the average human brain turns off after about 7 minutes of being talked at: accordingly we recommend you do a bit of 'chalking and talking' (presenting and live coding), then have your participants work together to solve some problems.  Here in this repository you'll find a bank of learning challenges you can pick and choose from to use when you design your applicationi developer training.

## How to contribute problems to this learning challenges bank

A good set of challenges are a kind of beautiful puzzle which will be a great value to your participants as their learn how to make cloud applications.  Like any code repository you contribute 

To contribute a new problem-set please submit a minimum of 3x learning challenges (as a single file):

1. Novice problem, e.g. in groups of 2 to 6 attempt to overload a single CPU core with too many tasks.
2. Intermediate problem, e.g. in pair of people divide your workload over three workers
3. Advanced problem, e.g. setup orchestration to auto scale your workload over various workers

While the minimum problem-set MUST have 3x challenges, additional challenges and or contextual information may be provided the same file, such as:

 * Additional problems, i.e. Uber advanced extra bonus points problem: create auto monitorring and orchestration basedon regional location of cores/nodes.
 * Pictures of slides to remind the participants of what you orignally demonstrated, etc.
 * Links and references to what other problem-sets which are applicable.
 * etc

# Ok, now it's your turn...
1. Start by branching the following template problem-set file.
2. Once you've created your minimum 3x problems then submit a pull request so we can add your problem-set to master bank of learning challenges for OpenStack application developer training!
3. We'll start tweeting and singing your praises on the mailing list so our community of trainers can start using your newly minted learning challenges in their training.
